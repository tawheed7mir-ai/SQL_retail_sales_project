# 🛒 Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

### 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using **SQL** to uncover key insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends.  
It demonstrates how raw retail data can be transformed into actionable insights that help improve business decisions, profitability, and marketing strategies.

The project includes multiple SQL scripts that cover the complete analytical workflow — from **data exploration** and **cleaning** to **insight generation** and **business problem solving**.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** and ensure data integrity before analysis.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using SQL.  
- Identify **top-selling products** and **revenue-generating categories**.  
- Analyze **sales trends over time** (monthly, seasonal, yearly).  
- Understand **customer purchasing behavior** and **regional performance**.  
- Solve **key business questions** using analytical SQL queries.

### 🗂️ Dataset Information
The dataset represents a **retail sales business** and includes multiple dimensions:
- 🧾 **Sales Data:** Transaction details such as order date, product ID, quantity, and revenue.  
- 👤 **Customer Data:** Customer demographics like ID, location, and age group.  
- 📚 **Product Data:** Product category, pricing, and cost information.  
- 📍 **Store/Location Data:** Regional sales and store performance metrics.

### 🔍 Key Business Questions Solved
- What are the **top 10 best-selling products** by revenue?  
- Which **regions** generate the highest sales?  
- Who are the **most valuable customers** (by total purchase value)?  
- What is the **average sales per transaction** and how does it vary monthly?  
- How do **discounts or price changes** affect sales volume?  
- Which **product categories** perform best seasonally?

### 🧮 Analytical Steps
1. **Data Exploration**
   - Checked for null values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  
   - Verified data completeness and relationships between tables.  

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Replaced or removed invalid entries.  
   - Standardized column types (dates, prices, IDs).  
   - Handled missing values for critical columns.  

3. **Business Analysis**
   - Created SQL queries to calculate KPIs like total sales, revenue growth, and order counts.  
   - Applied aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) and grouping for trend insights.  
   - Used **joins**, **CTEs**, and **window functions** for advanced insights.
